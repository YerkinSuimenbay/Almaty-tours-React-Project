# Almaty-tours-React-Project
This is a small project build to practice my skills in React.

First of all, there is a loading page. After that, you will see the main page, where you can press READ MORE button to read more, obviously, and SHOW LESS to hide the long info. Plus, there is an MAYBE ANOTHER TIME button which will delete that tour from the list. 
If no more tours are left, then there is a REFRESH button which will restart all over again.

Relating to the tech part, the following was used:
  - HTML 5
  - SASS
  - React (useState, useEffect hooks, props, multiple components)
  - JS (fetching local json file, ES6)
